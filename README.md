## Objective

The objective is having folks walk away from this workshop with less of a fear
of operations and be empowered to set up trivial production environments of
their own.


### Troubleshooting

#### I'm running Windows 7 / 8 or earlier

Unfortunately to follow along with this workshop you'll either need to have a
virtual machine running a linux distrobution or Cygwin/mingw

To install Cygwin,

1. Download the setup exe file ([32-bit](https://cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe) / [64-bit](https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe)
2. Run the setup program

#### I'm running Windows 10

Great! You should be able to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux:
